## REST API 
After REST APIs became widely used, there was no need to worry about the type of the client.   
Just provide the endpoints and the response will generally contain data in the JSON or any other standard data transport format.   
Additionally, the client will handle the data in whatever way they want.
The REST-API acts as a gateway, or a single-entry point into the system.  
 It acts as the interface, and the communication between the client and the server happens over HTTP.
